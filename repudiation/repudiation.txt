- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Repudiation refers to the proper logging of system actions so the server can hold users accountable for their actions.
In secure.js, the middleware function is going to create a log entry with a timestamp, 
the req.method, the req.url, and the IP. The entry will be written into a private log. 
This allows for the server to monitor users and their actions to make sure that errors/malicious actions
are handled properly.
