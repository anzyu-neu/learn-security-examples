- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

In a DOS attack, malicious users can overwhelm the server with high volume of requests or exploit vulnerabilities in the server. 
This denial of service violates CIA. 

Even though for Mongo generates IDs and indexes the IDs for queries (such as ID identification), we still need to sanitize the input. 
Unsanitized inputs can cause the server to crash. The secure.js uses a try/catch block to handle errors instead of crashing the server.
We should use a rate limiting middleware that will ensure requests don't exceed a certain amount that would crash the server.
