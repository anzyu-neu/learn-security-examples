For the session user, we are taking user input as the name and simply setting 
the input value as the name. Attackers could input code snippets instead of a name, leading to tampering.

In the secure.js file, the escapeHTML function checks the input for code snippets and converts everything to strings. 
We can use libraries in express to clean the inputs or define them ourselves. 

Tampering violates integrity as the attackers are causing unintended actions by changing input.
