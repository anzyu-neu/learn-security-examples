Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The example demonstrates how an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the user database. 
This violates confidentiality. 
Userinfo is using a Mongo query to access the database. 
The username is coming from an external source, so malicious code/query may be included in the username.
In the example discussed in class, the malicious user is using a regular expression to pull all usernames that are not blank
spaces. The system should sanitize and ensure that only strings are accepted. 
We can include further authentification, monitor console logs, and use encryption for storage/transit of sensitive information
as additional security mechanisms.
